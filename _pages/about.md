    Agriculture technology, also known as agtech, refers to the use of
    technology in the agricultural industry to increase productivity,
    efficiency, and sustainability. It encompasses a wide range of
    innovations, such as precision agriculture, automation, biotechnology,
    and robotics.

    <p style="width: 48%;">
      Precision agriculture, for example, uses GPS and remote sensing
      technology to help farmers optimize their crop production by
      providing them with data on soil quality, crop health, and weather
      patterns. Automation technologies like drones, sensors, and robotic
      machines help farmers automate tasks like crop monitoring,
      irrigation, and harvesting, which can save time and improve
      efficiency.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 48%;">
      Biotechnology plays a crucial role in agriculture technology as
      well. It involves the use of genetically modified crops and
      microorganisms to increase crop yield and resilience to pests and
      diseases. Robotics also offer great potential in agriculture
      technology by providing solutions for labor shortages, allowing for
      more efficient and precise farming practices.

    Overall, agriculture technology has the potential to revolutionize the
    agricultural industry by enabling farmers to produce more food with
    fewer resources while reducing the environmental impact of farming.
